# adventofcode2020
My participation for the advent of code event in 2020.
Working with plain ES6 JavaScript, simply because I don't know any other solution.
Ran into more issues with gitHub and reading the tasks that solving them, so far..

Having fun and learning alot, that;s the point in the end right?
